Group Pre-K Counts and Head Start together under an "Early Childhood Education" Page.

Take the Head Start locations off of the Home Page and just list them on the Early Childhood Education Page.

Add the Hazelwood Family Center to the list of links.

Include links to relevant legislation and governmental offices, for example:
    Link to BIA on the Home Page
    Link to ICWA on the Home Page
    Link to the Head Start Act on the Early Childhood Education and Early Head Start Pages
    Make the Poverty Guidelines listings on the Program Pages more uniform for all relevant Pages
    Link to the WIA Act on the WIA Page 
    List the WIA offices similar to the way the Head Start sites are listed. (I don't like that chart format on the WIA page now.)

List the Board Members on the Home Page
List the Policy Counsel Members on the Early Childhood Education and Early Head Start Pages

Is our Mission Statement somewhere on the website? I may have missed it.
Does/should our website include our Annual Statement (or a link)?

    "text": "Head Start is a federally funded preschool program that serves low income at risk preschool children and their families, living at or below the federal poverty level. As such, these children are already considered “at risk” of entering kindergarten significantly less well prepared to learn and be successful in school. To address this issue, Head Start provides services which work together to increase school readiness and improve the quality of life for income eligible children and their families.  Services include education, nutrition, health and wellness, opportunities for family engagement and support services for families as well as services for children with special needs, transportation and more."
